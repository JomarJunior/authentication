🔑 Authentication
===

> *This is a live document and will be updated as the system evolves.*

🌐 Overview
---

This module aims to provide a robust authentication mechanism for many applications through a Single Sign-On (SSO) approach, leveraging industry standards such as OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

The scope of this module includes user authentication and registration, as well as token management and validation.

> This will be entirely developed for the personal usage of the author on many of their projects, any external usage is welcome but not officially supported.

This module will be built with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements and integrations as needed.

💻 The System
---

The Single Sign-On (SSO) system is designed to streamline user authentication by enabling users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. It operates by centralizing the authentication process, ensuring secure and seamless access across integrated systems. The system leverages OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols to provide secure token-based authentication, ensuring compliance with modern security standards. Key components include an authentication server, token issuance and validation mechanisms, and support for extensible integrations to accommodate future needs.

- 🎯 **Goals**
  - Simplify user authentication across multiple applications
  - Enhance security through centralized token management
  - Support for modern authentication standards (OAuth2, OIDC)
  - Provide a seamless user experience with single sign-on capabilities
  - Enable easy integration with existing applications and services

- ❌ **Non-Goals**
  - Implementing a full-fledged user management system
  - Supporting legacy authentication protocols
  - Providing extensive user interface components

- 🚉 **Supported Platforms**
  - Web applications (SPA, MPA)

> For now, only web applications are planned to be supported.

🏠 Architecture
---

The stack consists of a frontend application (React) to render the Login and Registration pages, and a backend API (Python + FastAPI) to handle authentication requests and user management.

- 👨‍💻 **Stack**
  - 🖥️ Frontend: *React*
    > React was chosen as the frontend framework for its component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and maintainability. Moreover, it has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that facilitate development and enhance user experience.
  - ⚙️ Backend: *Python + FastAPI*
    > FastAPI was selected for its high performance, ease of use, and automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation. It allows for rapid development of RESTful APIs with built-in support for data validation and serialization.
  - 🗄️ Database: *PostgreSQL*
    > PostgreSQL was chosen for its robustness, scalability, and support for advanced data types. It provides a reliable and efficient storage solution for user data and authentication tokens.
  - 🔒 Auth: *OAuth2 + OpenID Connect*
    > OAuth2 and OpenID Connect were selected for their industry-standard protocols for authorization and authentication. They provide a secure and flexible framework for managing user identities and access tokens.
  - 🧪 Testing: *Pytest + React Testing Library*
    > These tools were chosen for their ease of use and ability to facilitate comprehensive testing of both frontend and backend components.
  - 📝 Linter: *Pylint + ESLint*
    > These tools were selected to enforce coding standards and best practices across the codebase, helping to maintain code quality and consistency.
  - 🛠️ Formatter: *Prettier*
    > Prettier was chosen for its opinionated code formatting capabilities, ensuring a consistent code style across the frontend codebase.
  - 📦 Package Manager: *pip + npm*
    > Pip is used for managing Python packages, while npm is used for managing JavaScript packages. This combination allows for efficient dependency management across the entire stack.
  - 🚀 Deployment: *Docker + Kubernetes*
    > Docker is used to containerize applications, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production. Kubernetes is used for orchestrating and managing containerized applications at scale.

    > GitHub Actions is used to automate the CI/CD pipeline, enabling continuous integration and deployment of the application.
  - 📜 Documentation: *Markdown + PlantUML*
    > Markdown is used for writing documentation, while PlantUML is used for creating diagrams and visual representations of the system architecture. They both keep the documentation living and up-to-date with the codebase.
  - 🔒 Security: *OWASP Top Ten + SAST/DAST*
    > The OWASP Top Ten provides a comprehensive list of the most critical security risks to web applications, serving as a guideline for secure coding practices. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools are employed to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase and running applications, respectively.

Below is the block diagram for the SSO Authentication System:

```plantuml
@startuml
title "SSO Authentication System - Block Diagram"
!theme plain

package "Identity Provider (IdP)" {
  [Auth Server] as AuthServer
  [Token Service] as TokenService
  [User Database] as UserDB
  [External IdP] as ExternalIdP
}

[Client Application] as ClientApp
[Resource Server (API)] as ResourceServer

' Authentication flow
ClientApp --> AuthServer : Login Request (credentials)
AuthServer --> UserDB : Validate User
AuthServer --> ExternalIdP : OAuth2 / OIDC Flow (optional)

' Token issuance
AuthServer --> TokenService : Issue Token
TokenService --> ClientApp : Return Access/ID Token

' Resource access
ClientApp --> ResourceServer : API Request + Token
ResourceServer --> TokenService : Validate Token Signature / Keys

@enduml
```

- 📦 **Components and Responsibilities**
  - **Client Application**: Initiates authentication requests and handles user sessions.
  - **Authorization Server**: Issues access tokens and handles authorization flows.
  - **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Manages user identities, authentication, and token issuance.
  - **Token Service**: Issues and validates tokens (JWT, OAuth2).
  - **Resource Server (API)**: Protects resources and validates access tokens. They are the applications (APPs) that will integrate with the SSO system.
  - **User Database**: Stores user credentials and profiles.
  - **External Identity Providers**: Facilitates federated authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.).

The sequence diagram below illustrates the typical flow of the Authorization Code Grant with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) in the SSO Authentication System:

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
title "Authorization Code + PKCE — Sequence Diagram"
actor "User (Browser/Mobile)" as User
participant "Client App (Browser/MSA)" as Client
participant "Identity Provider (Auth Server + TokenService)" as IdP
participant "User Database" as UserDB
participant "External IdP (optional)" as ExternalIdP
participant "Resource Server (API)" as API
participant "JWKS Endpoint" as JWKS

== Step A: Authorization Request (via browser) ==
User -> Client : open /login -> redirect to IdP /authorize\n(client_id, redirect_uri, scope, state, code_challenge)
Client -> IdP : GET /authorize?client_id=...&code_challenge=...&state=...

note over IdP: IdP renders login page or redirects to ExternalIdP

alt External IdP
  IdP -> ExternalIdP : redirect user to external provider (OAuth2/OIDC)
  ExternalIdP -> IdP : callback with external assertion (token/code)
  IdP -> UserDB : map external identity or create link
else Local auth
  IdP -> UserDB : validate credentials (username/password, MFA)
end

IdP -> Client : HTTP 302 redirect to redirect_uri?code=AUTH_CODE&state=...

== Step B: Token Exchange (backend or SPA exchange + PKCE) ==
Client -> IdP : POST /oauth/token (grant_type=authorization_code, code, redirect_uri, code_verifier)
IdP -> IdP : verify code, verify code_verifier matches code_challenge (PKCE)
IdP -> IdP : create access_token (JWT signed RS256), id_token (optional), refresh_token (rotating)
IdP -> Client : 200 { access_token, id_token, refresh_token, expires_in, scope }

== Step C: Resource Access ==
Client -> API : GET /orders Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
API -> JWKS : GET /.well-known/jwks.json (cached)
API -> API : verify signature (kid), verify iss, aud, exp, nbf, scope
API -> Client : 200 OK { resource payload }

@enduml
```

The logout sequence diagram illustrates the flow of the logout process in the SSO Authentication System. It will support only APP-level logout, meaning the logout will only terminate the user session in the current application, not globally across all applications.

```plantuml
@startuml
title "Logout Sequence Diagram"
actor "User (Browser/Mobile)" as User
participant "Client App (Browser/MSA)" as Client
participant "Identity Provider (Auth Server + TokenService)" as IdP
participant "Resource Server (API)" as API

== Step 1: Logout Request ==
User -> Client : Clicks logout
Client -> IdP : GET /logout?id_token_hint=<id_token>\n&post_logout_redirect_uri=<redirect>
IdP -> IdP : End user session, revoke refresh tokens
IdP -> Client : Redirect to post_logout_redirect_uri

== Step 2: Resource Access (after logout) ==
Client -> API : GET /orders\nAuthorization: Bearer <old access_token>
API -> API : Validate JWT signature, claims (iss, aud, exp, nbf, scope)
alt Token expired or revoked (via introspection)
    API --> Client : 401 Unauthorized
else Token still valid (short lifetime not reached)
    API --> Client : 200 OK (still works until expiry)
end

@enduml
```

⛨ Security Considerations
---

- **Transport Security**: Enforce HTTPS for all communications to protect data in transit.
- **Password Handling**: Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for storing passwords.
- **Token Format**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for access tokens, ensuring they are signed and optionally encrypted.
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session management practices, including short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens with rotation.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities, such as failed login attempts and token misuse.
- **Protection against attacks**: Implement measures to protect against common attacks, such as CSRF, XSS, SQL injection, replay attacks, and brute force attacks.
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) regarding user data protection and privacy.

🎛️ Data Model
---

@dataclass
class Role:
    id: UUID
    name: str
    description: str
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

- 🔃 **Role Assignment Entity**

> The Role entities can be assigned to Users through a many-to-many relationship. This relationship is represented by the 'RoleAssignment' entity.

```python

    is_verified: bool
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    role_assignments: List[RoleAssignment]
```

- 🧩 **Token Type Enum**

> The Token Type Enum defines the various types of tokens used in the system, such as access tokens, refresh tokens, and ID tokens.

```python
from enum import Enum

class TokenType(str, Enum):
    BEARER = "bearer"
```

- 🎟️ **Access Token Entity**

> The Access Token entity represents a short-lived credential that allows the client to access protected resources on behalf of the user.

∫ Integration
---

The system will expose RESTful APIs for managing users, roles, and authentication tokens. The API will include endpoints for:

- User registration and management
- Role assignment and management
- Token issuance and revocation
- Client management

All API requests will be authenticated using OAuth 2.0, and responses will be in JSON format.

  - `GET /users`: List all users
  - `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve user information
  - `PUT /users/{id}`: Update user information
  - `POST /users/{id}/password`: Update user password
  - `POST /users/{id}/password/reset`: Reset user password
  - `POST /users/{id}/mfa`: Enable multi-factor authentication for a user
  - `POST /users/{id}/mfa/revoke`: Disable multi-factor authentication for a user

- **Role Assignment and Management**
  - `POST /users/{id}/roles`: Assign a role to a user
  - `DELETE /users/{id}/roles/{roleId}`: Remove a role from a user
  - `GET /users/{id}/roles`: List all roles assigned to a user

- **Token Issuance and Revocation**
  - `POST /oauth/token`: issue or refresh tokens (grant types: password, client_credentials, refresh_token, authorization_code)
  - `POST /oauth/revoke`: Revoke a token
  - `POST /oauth/introspect`: Introspect a token

- **Client Management**

  - `POST /clients/{id}/rotate`: Rotate client secret

- **OpenID Connect**
  - `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration`: Retrieve OIDC configuration
  - `GET /.well-known/jwks.json`: Retrieve JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) for token verification
  - `GET /userinfo`: Retrieve user information using an access token

The project will also provide a python and javascript SDK for easier integration with the authentication system of your applications.

Finally, the system will aim to integrate third-party identity providers using the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols, allowing users to authenticate using their existing accounts from providers like Google, Facebook, and others.

🚀 Deployment and Infrastructure
---

- **Environment Setup**: The system will be divided and deployed into three main environments: development, staging, and production. Each environment will have its own configuration settings, databases, and resources to ensure isolation and security.
- **Containerization**: The application will be containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent environments across development, testing, and production. Docker Compose will be used to define and run multi-container applications, including the API server, database, and any other required services.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: The system will implement centralized logging and monitoring using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana. This will help in tracking user activity, identifying issues, and ensuring the overall health of the application.
- **Backup and Recovery**: The system will implement regular backup and recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and availability. Backups will be stored securely and tested regularly to ensure they can be restored in case of data loss or corruption.

🧪 Testing Strategy
---

The project will follow the Test Driven Development (TDD) principles, ensuring that tests are written before the actual code implementation. This approach will help in maintaining high code quality, facilitating refactoring, and ensuring that the system meets the specified requirements.

- ***Steps of TDD***
  - 🔴 **Red**: Write a failing test case that defines the desired functionality.
  - 🟢 **Green**: Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
  - 🔄 **Refactor**: Refactor the code while keeping the tests green.

- 1️⃣ **Unit Testing**: Each component will have its own set of unit tests to ensure individual functionality works as expected.
- ∫ **Integration Testing**: The system will include integration tests to verify that different components work together as intended.
- 🛡️ **Security Testing**: The system will implement security tests to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that user data is protected.
- 📈 **Performance Testing**: The system will include performance tests to ensure that it can handle the expected load and respond quickly to user requests.

⚙️ Operational Considerations
---

- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  > The project will implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. This pipeline will automate the testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring that code changes are thoroughly tested and deployed to the appropriate environments seamlessly.

- **Rollback Strategy**
  > In case of a failed deployment or critical issue in production, the system will implement a rollback strategy to revert to the last known good state. This will involve:
  - Automated rollback procedures in the CI/CD pipeline to quickly revert changes.
  - Maintaining versioned backups of the application and database to restore previous states.
  - Thorough testing of rollback procedures to ensure they work as intended.
